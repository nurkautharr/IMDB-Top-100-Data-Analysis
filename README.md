<h1 align="center">IMDb Top 100 Movies: Data Analysis & Machine Learning</h1>

### Project Overview:
This project explores the IMDb Top 100 Movies dataset using Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), preprocessing and multiple machine learning techniques. The objective is to analyse trends in the dataset, handle missing values/outliers, perform discretisation and encoding and apply supervised and unsupervised learning algorithms to extract insights.

### Skills:
Data handling and preprocessing, Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), machine learning (supervised and unsupervised), analystics

### Task:

#### 1. Give brief explanation on the data set and select column with categorical and numerical values. (Minimum number of columns selected four (4)). 

#### 2. Conduct Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the dataset, i.e. mean, medium, standard deviation. 

#### 3. Perform analysis to find missing data as well as outliers and explain way of handling these problems.

#### 4. Perform data discretisation and binning, for continuous data. 

#### 5. Perform data encoding for any suitable column.

#### 6. Choose any 3 supervised machine learning model to be applied to data set. 
- Explained first the basis of classification made and any transformation of data required in order to perform the classification task. In each of the model, do some manual tuning parameter in order to see the effect of parameter tuning to the accuracy of the classifier. Make a report to explain from the assumption made in any data set and the performance obtained in each of the classifier.

#### 7. Optimisation in unsupervised and supervised machine learning 
- A: Unsupervised learning
  - Clustering dataset using K-means algorithm. Find the optimised K using the appropriate analysis.
  - Conduct one of hierarchical method to do the clustering
- B: Validation and optimisation
  - Repeat classification algorithm in 8 but optimsed the selected hyperparameter using K fold and grid search approach. Report the different in the performance compared to manual tuning applied in 8.
